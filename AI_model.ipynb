        "     \"answer\": \"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when certain nerve cells in the brain, especially in an area called the substantia nigra, become damaged or die. These cells normally produce dopamine—a chemical essential for coordinating smooth and controlled body movements.\"},\n",
        "\n",
        "    {\"question\": \"How does Parkinson's Disease occur?\",\n",
        "     \"answer\": \"PD occurs due to the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Without sufficient dopamine, the brain cannot send proper signals to control movement. The exact cause is unknown, but it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are commonly found in the brains of PD patients.\"},\n",
